Several examples than can help us to understand it:
- **Cookbook**: maybe you what add recipes of different categories and you what show it by milestones as timeline or book version.
- **Video game**: where we can see the different features (deployed, in development or to be develop) in several milestones as a timeline.
- **Software project** like this component. Yes, use this component to explain the evolution of himself.
